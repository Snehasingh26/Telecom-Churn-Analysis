Steps for Exploratory Data Analysis of Telecom Churn on IBM Cloud

1. Set Up IBM Cloud Services

Create an IBM Cloud account if you don't have one.
Set up necessary IBM Cloud services, such as IBM Watson Studio, IBM Cloud Object Storage, and IBM Watson Analytics.
Create a Project in IBM Watson Studio

2. Open IBM Watson Studio.
Create a new project and give it a name.
Add necessary services to the project, such as Cloud Object Storage.
Upload the Data

Upload your telecom churn dataset to IBM Cloud Object Storage.
Ensure the dataset is in a readable format (e.g., CSV).
Load the Data into a Notebook

3. Create a new Jupyter notebook in IBM Watson Studio.
Use the pandas library to load the data from IBM Cloud Object Storage.

4. Explore the Data
Get a quick overview of the dataset.
Data Cleaning

5. Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Convert data types if necessary.
Data Visualization

Use matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations.

Feature Analysis

6. Analyze key features that may contribute to churn.
Summary of Findings

7. Summarize the key insights and patterns identified during the analysis.
Save and Share the Notebook

8. Save the notebook and export it as a .ipynb file.
